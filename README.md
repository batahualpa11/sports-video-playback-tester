Hello, 

This project is a proof of concept. However, what I envision this project to be is to serve for many tests that are required for a functional video playback project, in specific towards sports video playback. 

I hope to learn a lot from this project as I seem to learn things quicker by consistently iterating, even if it may not be the correct way. I intend to gain a deep understanding of how these technologies I will be using. With that being said I think this will only further my passion of sports and technology.

# Sports Video Playback Tester
